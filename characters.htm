									<h2 class="major">THE SUPER FREAKS</h2>
									<p style="font-family: 'Comic Neue'; font-weight: bold">The universe's greatest heroes, four half brothers who use Unlimit Energy to create any possible superpower, especially the dumb ones!
										Some say they were the last survivors of the planet Whakk-O after it blew up. Others say they were veterans of the Freak Wars. Yet more people say they were superhero interns. Whatever origin is true, all that matters is they're the strongest beings to ever exist.</p>

										The Super Freaks live in a stadium on Mystic Island, which used to drift above what was once called Earth. Nowadays, the solar system has become the United States of Craziness, where cartoon characters and different varieties of monkeys and clowns live on increasingly bizarre planets.</p>

										<p style="font-family: Georgia,serif">Scruffy is a fun loving stickman who is always looking for a good time. This has led him to seek out a superhero career even since he was a kid! He was the one to drag his brothers into fighting evildoers in the first place, though they quickly took to it themselves. While Scruffy started his life as just a regular kid, he begin to take any threats on his life and the galaxy far less seriously, and grew increasingly goofier in his search for wacky things to do. After training with Ednaldo Pereira, Scruffy attained his most powerful form yet, with white gloves.</p>

										<p style="font-family: Georgia,serif">The only one of the Super Freaks with his head screwed on right. He has a cool, calm, and collected demeanor, which helps him keep his buddies in check. After his various good deeds, and being quite frankly the only sane Super Freak, King Quincy was given the title of King of Normal World and free access to the historic Normal Castle in Quincy, Massachusetts. This essentially amounts to him being consulted on important matters like how to properly open a jar of pickles. King Quincy has also been forced to go on a few solo adventures, usually whenever Dino or his robotic duplicate Negative Quincy acts up.</p>

										<p style="font-family: Georgia,serif">Gambi is a ghost--in theory. He doesn't look like a ghost, can't possess people, and isn't even dead! He sure can be scary though, with his firey temperament. Gambi wasn't always like this, however. In his youth, Gambi was a sweet kid, known for being afraid of almost anything that cast a shadow. Some say this all started after an incident where he got trapped in a cave full of spiders and had to escape on his own. Whatever is the case, something in him snapped one day. He's been a hot tempered justice seeker ever since!</p>

Tikiman's got a natural born intelligence, but his real secret is that as the years have gone on, he's built a second, cylindrical head with a satellite that he wears over his real head. This head remotely stores and downloads information from his personal database. This has had the side effect of making him very scatterbrained, though no less competent a fighter. Speaking of fighting, Tikiman's technology has made him an adept and deadly assassin. Provided he can actually focus, he'll know where you are at all times, and how to take you out.</p>

					<p style="font-family: Georgia,serif; color: black;">Uncle Swordsman is the greatest warrior in the entire universe. He is amazingly skilled with any weapon you hand him, and he will use it as elegantly as possible. Back in the day, Swordsman fought ancient freak villains like Marrow Prime, his arch-enemy; and Nemesis, the Freak Devil. Eventually, he forced his enemies into retirement. Left with not much else to do, Uncle Swordsman dialed back his own career and focused on training his nephews, the Super Freaks, to be the next generation of freak superheroes. These days, when he isn't stuck bailing his nephews out of trouble (and vice-versa), he likes to host small BBQ's at his suburban house and enjoy a casual lemonade martini on a lawn chair.</p>

					<p style="font-family: Georgia,serif; color: black;">Noh Bodee is one of the Freak Fathers, the oldest freaks ever created. He has extremely powerful telekinetic power which he often uses to warn people of danger through his trademark psychic messages. While he has, well, no body, he can sometimes spawn hands out of nowhere for comedic effect, although he is just as capable as grabbing things by contorting his lips. Noh Bodee is an easy going and sagely fellow, but he dislikes the Ribsons to the point of threatening to banish them. Then again, they're a tricky group to tell what to do!</p>

					<p style="font-family: Georgia,serif; color: black;">Despite his name and appearence, Old Tiki is actually NOT Tikiman from the future; he is actually a variant of Tikiman's younger self. When the great dark dragon Calliginis attacked his alternate timeline, a great battle was waged against it by the Super Freaks and Sticky's army of machines. They failed, and they were all absorbed...except for Tikiman, who turbo leaped through time and space to join the HUB and fight back.</p>

The Positive Dragon strives for peace and preserving the balance of the universes, between the Positive and Negative Realms (and the Multifreakiverse itself).  Capable of giving superpowers and providing Unlimit Energy, the Positive Freaky Dragon is a big part in the force of good.  P.S., nobody knows what his full body looks like.</p>

									<h2>THE RIBSON FAMILY, AND COMPANY</h2>

<p>The Ribson family of evil skeletons has been menacing the United States of Craziness for years. They're dumb enough to try to beat the Super Freaks, which is like playing tennis against a brick wall, but you almost admire the effort. It's a better hobby than bickering with each other, anyway!</p>

<p style="font-family: Georgia,serif; color: black;">Sticky is one of the Super Freaks' main enemies, and the one they've fought the most. While he is Marrow Prime's oldest son, he was born out of an extramarital affair in Lost Vegas, neither evil skeleton knowing they were related until later in life. Sticky spent a good portion of his life menacing the United States of Craziness, usually with robot invasions, only to vanish from the public eye to perfect his ultimate weapon, his time machine. This allowed his hated half-brother Kranion to fill the void he left and become the galaxy's strongest villain himself. After Kranion was forced to seek him out to deal with an impostor problem, the two skeletons are now forced to share an evil space with each other; and they hate that more than the Super Freaks!</p>

<p style="font-family: Georgia,serif; color: black;">Sticky's half brother, who is also one of the Super Freaks' main enemies. He is the proud son of Marrow Prime, and takes after his father in raw strength, Southie accent, and lack of brain power. In his youth, Kranion was a member of the Cheese Mafia, alongside the future Mayor Cheddar of the Floating City of New Cheeseland. They got along great until Cheddar's ruthless climb to power disillusioned him. When Sticky went into hiding to finish his time machine, the crafty Kranion spotted an opening, and strongarmed Sticky's minions into building him a space castle. While he isn't exactly built for evil plotting, as he spends most of his time trying to stroke his own ego, with a little power boost he's second only to Marrow Prime in strength and combat ability. Do not cross him by any means!</p>

<p style="font-family: Georgia,serif; color: black;">Some guy who is, for all intents and purposes, an exact doppleganger of Kranion. The only differences at all are his blue color scheme and that his name is spelt with a hard C instead of a K, so it's even pronounced the same. Nobody, not even Sticky or Tikiman, has any idea who he is or where he came from, and he'll never elaborate why. Cranion first appeared on the scene by pretending to be Kranion and stealing his castle. Despite this, it was nothing personal, and the two became fast friends, much to Sticky's chagrin.</p>

But when he's motivated, he can transform himself into a wizard of fantastical prowess.  He is able to summon creatures and wizards from across the Multifreakiverse. And he cast destructive spells, amazing illusions, and what-nots...  He is even responsible for suppling Mayor Cheddar with a crazy wizard army! Lord Humerus is a force to be reckoned with.</p>

<p style="font-family: Georgia,serif; color: black;">Marrow Prime, the Skull King, is the most brutal evil tyrant who ever lived, with a power level far exceeding any known being in the universe. While he was just one of the many skeletal creatures toiling away in Hell, he turned on the freak devil Nemesis and stole his power before leaving him to rot. He ravaged galaxies for years, only to be stopped every time by Uncle Swordsman. Eventually, the two came to an understanding, and Marrow Prime decided to give up his power and retire to civilian life. These days, Marrow Prime enjoys his days as a bumbling sitcom dad, going out drinking and golfing with his old nemesis. In a shocking twist of fate, he is actually the nicest of the Ribsons by far, and is a good father to his children. ...that doesn't stop him from coming out of retirement once in a while, however.</p>
