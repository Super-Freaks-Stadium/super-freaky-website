									<h2 class="major">THE SUPER FREAKS</h2>
									<p style="font-family: 'Comic Neue'; font-weight: bold">The universe's greatest heroes, four half brothers who use Unlimit Energy to create any possible superpower, especially the dumb ones!
										Some say they were the last survivors of the planet Whakk-O after it blew up. Others say they were veterans of the Freak Wars. Yet more people say they were superhero interns. Whatever origin is true, all that matters is they're the strongest beings to ever exist.</p>

										The Super Freaks live in a stadium on Mystic Island, which used to drift above what was once called Earth. Nowadays, the solar system has become the United States of Craziness, where cartoon characters and different varieties of monkeys and clowns live on increasingly bizarre planets.</p>

										<h3>John "Scruffy" Super Freaks</h3>
								

										<table><tr>
											<td ><p><img src="images/Scruffy.png" style=" width: 25%; min-width: 240px;"></td><td><img src="images/ScruffyClassic.png" style=" width: 25%; min-width: 240px;"></td>
											</tr>
											<tr><td>Modern Scruffy</td><td>Classic Scruffy</td></tr>

										</div>


											<table><tr><td><b>First Created:</b> 2000</b><br><b>First In-game Appearance:</b> Super Freaks 1: The Search for Tikiman (2006)</td>
												<td>Likes injecting things into raw chicken and cooking it, playing tetherball with a beehive, and drums</td>
											</tr>
										</table>

										<p style="font-family: Georgia,serif">Scruffy is a fun loving stickman who is always looking for a good time. This has led him to seek out a superhero career even since he was a kid! He was the one to drag his brothers into fighting evildoers in the first place, though they quickly took to it themselves. While Scruffy started his life as just a regular kid, he begin to take any threats on his life and the galaxy far less seriously, and grew increasingly goofier in his search for wacky things to do. After training with Ednaldo Pereira, Scruffy attained his most powerful form yet, with white gloves.</p>

										<h3>Quincy "King Quincy" Wilson</h3>

										<table><tr>
											<td ><p><img src="images/KingQuincy.png" style=" width: 25%; min-width: 240px;"></td><td><img src="images/KingQuincyClassic.png" style=" width: 25%; min-width: 240px;"></td>
											</tr>
											<tr><td>Modern Quincy</td><td>Classic Quincy</td></tr>
										</table>
											<table><tr><td><b>First Created:</b> 2000</b><br><b>First In-game Appearance:</b> Quincy's Adventure (2006)</td>
												<td>Likes sitting on hammocks, casually watching superhero movies, bass, and saxophone</td>
											</tr>
										</table>

										<p style="font-family: Georgia,serif">The only one of the Super Freaks with his head screwed on right. He has a cool, calm, and collected demeanor, which helps him keep his buddies in check. After his various good deeds, and being quite frankly the only sane Super Freak, King Quincy was given the title of King of Normal World and free access to the historic Normal Castle in Quincy, Massachusetts. This essentially amounts to him being consulted on important matters like how to properly open a jar of pickles. King Quincy has also been forced to go on a few solo adventures, usually whenever Dino or his robotic duplicate Negative Quincy acts up.</p>

										<h3>Gambi Ghost</h3>

										<table><tr>
											<td ><p><img src="images/Gambi.png" style=" width: 25%; min-width: 240px;"></td><td><img src="images/GambiClassic.png" style=" width: 25%; min-width: 240px;"></td>
											</tr>
											<tr><td>Modern Gambi</td><td>Classic Gambi</td></tr>
										</table>
											<table><tr><td><b>First Created:</b> 2005</b><br><b>First In-game Appearance:</b> Escape the Spider Maze</td>
												<td>Likes Molotov cocktails, ASMR videos, and guitar</td>
											</tr>
										</table>

										<p style="font-family: Georgia,serif">Gambi is a ghost--in theory. He doesn't look like a ghost, can't possess people, and isn't even dead! He sure can be scary though, with his firey temperament. Gambi wasn't always like this, however. In his youth, Gambi was a sweet kid, known for being afraid of almost anything that cast a shadow. Some say this all started after an incident where he got trapped in a cave full of spiders and had to escape on his own. Whatever is the case, something in him snapped one day. He's been a hot tempered justice seeker ever since!</p>

										<h3>Tikiman T. Tikiman III</h3>

										<table><tr>
											<td ><p><img src="images/Tikiman.png" style=" width: 25%; min-width: 240px;"></td><td><img src="images/TikimanClassic.png" style=" width: 25%; min-width: 240px;"></td>
											</tr>
											<tr><td>Modern Tikiman</td><td>Classic Tikiman</td></tr>
										</table>
											<table><tr><td><b>First Created:</b> 2005</b><br><b>First In-game Appearance:</b> Super Freaks 1: The Search for Tikiman</td>
												<td>Likes porting Doom to his eye sockets, i nventing the craziest weapons you've ever seen and forgetting why, singing, and piano</td>
											</tr>
										</table>

										<p style="font-family: Georgia,serif">Tikiman is one of the smartest beings in the entire universe--not bad for a guy made of wood! Tikiman's got a natural born intelligence, but his real secret is that as the years have gone on, he's built a second, cylindrical head with a satellite that he wears over his real head. This head remotely stores and downloads information from his personal database. This has had the side effect of making him very scatterbrained, though no less competent a fighter. Speaking of fighting, Tikiman's technology has made him an adept and deadly assassin. Provided he can actually focus, he'll know where you are at all times, and how to take you out.</p>
