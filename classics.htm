<h2>Discover some of the original Super Freaks games!</h2>

<p>You probably know by now that Ultimate is a remake (well, remakequel at this point) of Super Freaks 1 from all the way back from 2006.  But there's actually a whole truckload of other old Super Freaks games, smashed together into one Classic Pack!</p>


<p style="background: silver; font-family: Tahoma,sans; font-size: 10pt;"><b>IMPORTANT:</b> Several of these games include "Polished" versions that fix bugs, rebalance the difficulty, and sometimes even add new features where appropriate.<br />While the original versions of them are included for historical purposes, they're tucked away in folders and the Polished versions are presented upfront, because you really should just play those instead.</p>
